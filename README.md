## What's new?

In spite of the deprecation of [the original library](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc),
many people still want to use it. This library is a complete rewrite of the original library
that uses a modern C++ style and has more features.

### Features
- **Modern C++**: This library is written in C++23 and follows builder patterns as much as possible.
- **Buttons**: Undocumented/unimplemented feature in discord, that allows you to add custom links to your presence.
- **Project integration**: Say goodbye to copying library files or dealing with RapidJSON errors. This library can be easily integrated into your project without any hassle.
- **Cross-platform**: This library is designed to work on all supported platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- ~~**Wine support**: Library provides internal layer to support Wine, no extra configuration needed.~~
